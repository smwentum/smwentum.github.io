Hi welcome to my blog. This is my blog about my programming "journey". I am a professional .Net developer in Columbia, SC.

The reason why I am doing this blog is that I want some accountability in my learning journey. I think I have been guilty of jumping from online tutorial to online tutorial.

Learning new things, isn't a bad thing, but I think I want to to take things further and be able to build something new with the information that I am picking up.

I have been learning about angular and .Net Core I am going to start to make a Email Client kind of like Gmail called 'Sai-Mail'.

The stack I am going to use is angular for frontend and .Net Core for a backend. I think this would help me be a better developer because I would have to do things deal with authentication and  communication between servers. Plus I don't get to/ afraid to use something stronger than Jquery at work. So using real frontend framework would be helpful.

The list big list of things I want to think about while doing the project are:

- Actually be able to send and receive an email
- Have some sort of testing 
- Have documentation

What do I think will stop my from getting to my goals: 

- Getting stuck is minutiae (like restart starting a blog before starting the project)
- Burn out / Apathy about the project
- I get distracted by some other project I want to do.

I think thats enough for right now thank you for reading
