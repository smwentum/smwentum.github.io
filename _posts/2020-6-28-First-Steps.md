I started work on the project. I think I have basic routing for one of the modules. I think one thing I need to learn is about angular modules and routing. I got real tripped up with it this time.

I think I have a little bit of the routing done, and i started working on the sign-up form. The page looks terrible because I haven't done any css styling. I am thinking about adding bootstrap or maybe material ui, but i don't have a big preference at this pont.
